# Caesar Cipher Project

This program provides a utility to encrypt a message using the Caesar Cipher method.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher Project is a straightforward JavaScript program that runs in a browser. When the HTML page is loaded, the user is prompted to:

1. Enter the message they want to encrypt.

The program then encrypts the message using the Caesar Cipher method with a fixed shift value of 15 and displays the encrypted message in the browser's console.

## Usage

1. Open `cypher.html` in a web browser.
2. Input the desired message for encryption when prompted.
3. Check the browser's console to view the encrypted message.
